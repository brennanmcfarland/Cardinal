# Cardinal

## Cardinal is a Digital Voice Assistant and Accessibility Tool written in Python. It is also the (cute) state bird of Ohio:

Cardinal receives user input via the device's microphone, and transforms the _speech to text_ using the __Microsoft Azure 
Cognitive Services Platform__. Cardinal can detect the intent of a message - the service being requested - 
and the entity to perform the service upon where relevant.

After the service code is executed, the text output is then sent back to the Cognitive Services Platform to request a 
_text to speech_ result from the Azure. Cardinal downloads the response .mp3 and plays back the audio.

Cardinal has four primary features as a digital assistant:

* Getting the time

* Getting current news headlines from Google News

* Getting the weather in a city
    * This will also open a web page to display more info than is spoken by the problem.

* Opening a requested Wikipedia page in a new browser


Here are some example commands:

Getting the time:
```
python main.py

...

'Recording audio'
User speaks: 'What is the time?'

The time is 04:07 AM, on Sunday, 28 of October, 2018 
```

Getting the news headlines:
```
